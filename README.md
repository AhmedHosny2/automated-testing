This project demonstrates automated testing using Selenium and Pytest for a PrestaShop demo site.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```
pip install selenium pytest python-dotenv
```
Configuration

    Create a .env file in both the src and test folders.

    Add the following line to the .env file, replacing <YOUR_SITE_URL> with the URL obtained from the PrestaShop demo site:

    To get the URL:
        Open the PrestaShop demo site.
        Click on the "Log in" button.
        Open the browser's inspector.
        Navigate to "No account? Create one here" and copy the URL.
